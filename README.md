This is the farewell letter that I wrote to Flexport, after almost three years of employment.
My journey with Flexport comes to this moment.   
There is no party that won't be ended and there is no goodbye that won't be given.   
With all the memorable minutes that I had in here, I give my best wishes to my dear colleagues and the Flexport.
